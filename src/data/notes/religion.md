> With respect to religion, one new speech norm seems to be that if large numbers of people believe something to be the truth, we cannot risk offending them. If a religious community says they find something offensive, that sentiment must trump the principle of freedom of speech or at least be granted equal weight. A related rule of thumb: in the name of respecting religion, we must couch any criticism of religion in euphemistic, palatable, and mild language â€“ never mind that most religious traditions have plenty in them that is disrespectful to one or more categories of humanity, women, non-believers, members of another faith and more.
